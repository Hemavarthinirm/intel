# üå± AI POWERED SMART IRRIGATION üåßÔ∏èüíß

## Project Overview
This project proposes a smart irrigation system that integrates AI-powered weather prediction with real-time soil moisture monitoring. By analyzing weather forecasts (temperature, humidity, precipitation) and soil moisture sensor data, the system utilizes machine learning models to predict crop water requirements and optimize irrigation schedules.

## Features
1. *Integration of AI-powered Weather Prediction:* Utilizes machine learning models to analyze weather forecasts (temperature, humidity, precipitation) for accurate predictions.
2. *Real-time Soil Moisture Monitoring:* Monitors soil moisture levels in real-time using sensors for precise irrigation scheduling.
3. *Optimized Irrigation Schedules:* Utilizes AI-generated crop water requirements to optimize irrigation schedules, reducing water waste and ensuring optimal crop health.
4. *Data-driven Approach:* Relies on data analysis to make informed decisions, potentially increasing yields while promoting sustainability.
5. *Development Outline:* Details the process of acquiring data from weather services and sensors, developing AI models for weather and soil moisture prediction, and implementing optimized irrigation control.
6. *Future Advancements:* Discusses potential advancements such as mobile app integration and disease/pest prediction for further enhancement of agricultural practices.
